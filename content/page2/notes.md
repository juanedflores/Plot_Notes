sine and cosine - are functions revealing the shape of a right triangle. Looking out from a vertex with angle θ, sin(θ) is the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse, while cos(θ) is the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse.

sin(θ) = opposite / hypotenuse
cos(θ) = adjacent / hypotenuse
