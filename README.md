# Math Notes Book
The goal of this book is to have my most important math notes in one physical place. They are stored in svg format to easily draw them on paper using a pen plotter. My physical copy uses a page with the dimensions of 14cm x 19 cm. 

I am using a combination of matplotlib, processing, and pure data for the visualizations. I am also using Herchey Text v3.0 from the AxiDraw extension for Inkscape. The font is HersheySans1.

This is a working title, because I plan to also include notes relating to music theory, sound synthesis, and computer science.
